    <h2>About Luna Café</h2>
    <p>
      Luna Café was founded with a love for earthy flavors, aromatic coffee, and cozy, welcoming spaces.
      From humble beginnings, we envisioned a café that would become a neighborhood staple — a place
      where every visitor feels at home.

      ingredients that are fresh, seasonal, and ethically sourced.

      Luna Café partners with local suppliers and farmers to bring fresh, seasonal produce to our menu.
      We actively participate in community events and initiatives, aiming to give back wherever we can.
      Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do, from composting and recycling to
      eco-friendly packaging and energy-efficient operations.
